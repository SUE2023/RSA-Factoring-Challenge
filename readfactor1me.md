Explanations of rsa1 code

1. `from sys import argv`: This line imports the `argv` function from the `sys` module, which helps access command-line arguments.

2. `with open(argv[1]) as f:`: Opens the file specified in the command line arguments for reading (`argv[1]` is the second argument, typically a filename).

3. `for line in f:`: Loops through each line in the file.

4. `num = int(line)`: Converts each line (considered as a string) into an integer and assigns it to the variable `num`.

5. `print("{:d}=".format(num), end="")`: Prints the number without a newline character but ends with an equals sign.

6. `if num % 2 == 0:`: Checks if the number is even. If so, it prints the number as the product of 2 and half the number.

7. `for i in range(3, num, 2):`: Initiates a loop to check divisors from 3 up to the number (skipping even numbers).

8. `if num % i == 0:`: Checks if the number is divisible by `i`. If so, it further checks if the quotient is also divisible only by odd numbers (i.e., it's a prime factorization).

9. `factor = num//i`: Calculates the quotient of `num` divided by `i`.

10. `for j in range(3, factor, 2):`: Initiates another loop to check if the quotient (factor) or the current divisor `i` is divisible by any odd number (checking for non-prime factors).

11. `if factor % j == 0 or i % j == 0:`: If any of the numbers are divisible by `j`, it breaks out of the loop to avoid printing non-prime factors.

12. `print("{}*{}".format(factor, i))`: Prints the prime factors found if they pass the prime factorization check.

This code reads numbers from a file, checks for their prime factors, and prints them in a specific format, showing the factorization of each number.
